					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q1. In which language are your training and conferences given? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>They are always given in English.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q2. Where do the events, workshops and bootcamps take place? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The bootcamp is taking place in our lab, which is located in Brussels, Belgium. 
						  <br/><br/>Most of ours events and workshops are happening in Belgium, but not especially in Brussels. 
						  <br/><br/>Due to its small size and its central location, Belgium is very accessible from anywhere in Europe. Only an hour and a half away from Paris or Amsterdam by train, Brussels hosts a huge expat community and a growing tech and stratup ecosystem.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q3. For whom is Philos' conferences and events? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The events organized by Philos target an audience of developers. However, even if you are not a developer, you are more than welcome to attend them. We sometimes find IT project managers or CEOs attending our events as they want to keep up to date with the latest technologies and trends and get the pulse directly from developers on those topics. 
						  Workshops are more selective, as it is exclusively for developers. As for the intensive training, each participant has to go through an admission process before he or she can attend the workshop. For more details, check the next two questions.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q4. For whom is Philos' intensive program? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Philos’ intensive training is aimed at developers, whether you are a freelancer or part of a company, it doesn’t matter. All participants should master at least one language other than JavaScript (Java, PHP, C#, C++, Python, Scala, Go ...). Each candidate go through an admission process. This process allows us to determine if you have the necessary skills to attend the intensive training. It also helps us group cohorts according to their level, which improves both productivity and the learning experience of each participant.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q5. How does the admission process work? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p><span class="bold-5">Registration:</span> You register online on the <a href="https://admission.philos.io" class="philos-orange">admission page</a>. 
							<br/><span class="bold-5">In person Interview:</span> In the application form, we’ll ask you to pick a date at which you’re available for an in-person interview. During the interview, we assess your level which will in turn help us to determine if you’re eligible for the intensive training and if your skills matches those of the other participants. 
							<br/><span class="bold-5">Decision:</span> We deliver an admissions decision to you, and talk about next-steps.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q6. I am a lead developer or an IT team manager, can I register my team? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Absolutely. During the <a href="https://admission.philos.io" class="philos-orange">admission process</a>, you have the opportunity to add candidates. Just fill in their contact details. We will contact the candidates individually to set an in-person interview. Note that the maximum number of candidate you can add is 10, as it is the maximum number of participants we accept for each of our intensive training. If you would like to add more than 10 candidates, restart the admission process for another date or <a href="/contact" class="philos-orange">contact us</a> directly.</p></div>

					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q7. Why should I attend Philos' intensive training? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>In the current state of development, if you want to be able to build amazing products and be at the top of your game as a developer, there is no way passed it: you have to master JavaScript. But at Philos, we want to make you more than “just a coder”, we want to make you a visionary software developer who’s always one step ahead. 
						<br/><br/>Our intensive program has been crafted with careful planning based on our experience working in tech companies and on thousands of hours 	experimenting and building products with bleeding edge technologies. 
						We work with small cohort to give all the necessary support and truly engage with the participants. We know what it takes from a professional, personal and mental level to be at the top.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q8. Why JavaScript? ... JavaScript is the new black! <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>No, we are not saying that JavaScript (JS) will be the only remaining language in 10 years (although it feels like it). To prove it, just look at the number of job ads for Cobol or Mainframe developers that still remain today. However, JavaScript’s presence has increased so much over the last couple of years, it is now almost impossible to think about creating an app (web, mobile or even smart objects) without writing any JS. JavaScript is unavoidable on the browser, it is becoming a commodity on the back end too with Nodejs or Meteor and is promised to a bright future on mobile with the possibility to build Native app with JS too with frameworks such as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" class="philos-orange" target="_blank">React Native</a>. 
						<br/><br/>The web industry is moving fast. Consumers keep asking for more sophisticated, responsive, dynamic and faster interactions which pushes software engineers to bring the technologies and methods to the next level. After thousands of hours of research, monitoring and experimentation, we have come to the conclusion that JavaScript is the future. And it’s not only about web development, it also includes IoT, Mobile and Robotics. 
						<br/>The awesome part is that you do not even have to know multiple languages anymore to build applications, JS covers it all. By default, mastering JS makes you a Full-Stack developer. You will be amazed how fast and productive you can become when truly mastering this single-language stack. There are plenty of “success” or “epiphany” stories of companies switching from one language to JavaScript. Here is the <a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2013/11/22/node-js-at-paypal/" class="philos-orange" target="_blank">one from Paypal</a> that illustrates the huge gain they made by switching from Java to Node.js.</p></div>

					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q9. Why AngularJS? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>We chose AngularJS alongside JavaScript for multiple reasons. AngularJS has become incredibly popular in the enterprise world. Most of the applications and front-end jobs out there are asking for AngularJS skills. It is probably the most demanded JavaScript skill. 
					      <br/>					      
					      Maintained by Google, AngularJS benefits from a huge team of clever brains dedicated to making the framework better. What's more, for its next version, AngularJS 2.0, Microsoft will also contribute to its improvement as this version will be using TypeScript.
					      <br/>
					      Last but not least, Angular is also used heavily with Ionic, an increasingly popular mobile framework that allows to build hybrid apps for any platform. Once you mastered AngularJS, Ionic is just a formality.

					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q10. What will I learn at Philos? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>We always strive for the best, state of the art tools and technologies in the industry. Nevertheless, we are well aware that those tools, processes and technologies are not going to stay forever. This is why our mission is to make you a wizard at the everlasting fundamental concepts that you will use throughout your career. To have a more precise view on the technologies that we are teaching, take a look at our <a href="/program" class="philos-orange">intensive program</a> or at our <a href="/events" class="philos-orange">community events</a>. </p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q11. Which tools are we going to learn? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Tooling is probably what makes JS the best language. During the training you will be using AWS, Heroku, Microsoft Azure and Surge to deploy your application. We will also show you how to make the best of tools such as webpack, gulp, codeship, travis for continuous integration (CI) and many more.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q12. Will I build any project during the intensive training?  <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Yes, indeed you will get your hands dirty, very dirty actually. We are strong believers in the learning by doing method. A majority of the curriculum is dedicated to participants strengthening their skills by building, breaking and debugging applications. 
						<br/>Theory and fundamental concepts will only account for a limited part of the training. Most of the time you will get to hack in pairs or with a mentor who will share with you the best practices and how to apply the latest development efficiently in your project.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q13. Why would your training be better than learning online? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>There are plenty of e-learning resources that are incredibly good and we think that’s great. If you come from a developing background, learning online should actually fell very natural as most of the developers are self-taught and are used to reading/watching documentation online. 
						<br/><br/>However, learning in small groups, with carefully planned curriculum and examples makes things so much more efficient and valuable. When stuck or when not understanding something, you can just ask and get the answer right away. Working in pairs on new technologies allows you to push each other forward while also teaching you other soft skills (mentoring, leadership, …) when interacting with you partner. 
						<br/>Mentors share with you all the best practices and tips they learned along the way. Besides, working in groups on projects or issues is so much more enjoyable than doing it alone. Combined, all these added-value will make you gain an incredible amount of time while also teaching you invaluable skills that you will be able to use all your life, even outside of the work sphere.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q14. What do I need to attend Philos' workshops or training? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The good thing is that materially speaking, there aren’t that many things you should bring. Here is the <a href="/program" class="philos-orange">list of things</a>  you will need to bring/have installed on your machine.
						<br/><br/>But more importantly, you need to come with a fresh, rested, open mind and a huge appetite for learning. 
						For workshops as well as for the intensive training, we provide snacks and drinks for the breaks. For bootcampers, the breakfast is also provided. While eating we’ll discuss what we learned/achieved the day before or just relax and chitchat before the coding frenzy starts!	</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q15. Requirements to meet before the intensive training. <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Actually, your training starts 2 weeks before the initial starting date. You will have to go through a set of tutorials in JavaScript and Angular in order to assure that you have what It takes to survive during our session. You will build an application and deploy it to the world. During the training, will rebuild the same application 3 times by using different techniques, by adding entreprise practises to build software with Testing (TDD/BDD), Continuous Integration and team collaboration tools.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q16. What are the dates of the intensive program? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Our next intensive training starts on the 14th of September. For the next cohorts, you can have a look on our <a href="/program#price-format" class="philos-orange">program's format section.</a></p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q17. How many days does the intensive program last? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>It lasts 6 days. From Monday to Saturday. For more information on the format you can refer to our<a href="/program#price-format" class="philos-orange">program's format section.</a></p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q18. What is the schedule of the intensive program? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>As detailed on the <a href="/program" class="philos-orange">program page</a>, the day starts at 8:30 and finishes at 18:00. Nevertheless, our instructors stay until 21:00 so that participants have the opportunity to get personalized insights and advice on the technology or on their personal projects.  </p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q19. What is the cost of the 1 intensive program? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Tuition is 1890€ per person (excluding taxes) for the 6 days.   

						<br/>We set high standards for ourselves and for you, and our tuition reflects that investment. Philos’ workshops are the best developer programs you will find on the market. We don’t only teach the bleeding edge technologies, we also experiment and test their limit to extract the very best of it before we share it with you. Further, mentors from various companies and with different core competencies share with you all the best practices and tips they learned along the way.
						<br/><br/><!-- If you are based in Brussels, you can ask for this help. If granted, it'll reduce your costs by 50%. (FR: http://www.werk-economie-emploi.irisnet.be/formation ; NL: http://www.werk-economie-emploi.irisnet.be/nl/formation) -->
						<br/>If you come from outside Belgium, you have to check with your own country for the procedure to recover the VAT. In Belgium, the VAT is set at 21%.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div id="convince" class="collapsible-header">Q20. How to convince my manager? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Chances are that your managers won’t be as enthusiastic as you when telling them about the intensive training. We have also been in such situations, so over the years we gathered some arguments that helped us (and hopefully you too) convince them:					      
					      <br/><br/>1. Training costs are fully deductible
					      <br/><br/>2. Possibility to work and get mentorship/personalized help on company project during the training's after hours (6pm - 9pm)
					      <br/><br/>3. As a <strong>consultant</strong>
					      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. You’ll be eligible for more missions & your rate will be higher.
					      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;b. On average, the return On Investment (ROI) is achieved in less than 3 months. If your rate after the training is 100€ higher, you will need 19 working days to reimburse the 1890€ of the training. To cover the costs for the week during which you didn't work at a customer, it might take between 1 or 2 months, depending on how much they charge the customer. For example, if they bill you at 600€ per day, they will have to recover 3000€ (600€x5). This will be done in 30 working days if your daily rate increased by 100€.
					      <br/><br/>4. As an <strong>employee</strong>
					      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Mastering JavaScript will make you a fullstack developer. You will have the knowledge to work on the front end, back end, mobile and even IoT.
					      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Personal development, possibility to work on more interesting/attractive projects. Increase company retention rate of their employees.
					      <br/><br/>5. Most performance issues, memory leaks and other bugs come from developers thinking they know Javascript, often using or re-using JS code without actually knowing what is behind it. Time loss, customer complaints and security issues can often reach several hundreds of thousands euros if not more. 
					      </p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div id="freelancer" class="collapsible-header">Q21. I am a freelancer, how can I reduce the intensive training’s tuition by 50%? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>By becoming a mentor at Philos, we give you the opportunity to reduce your tuition cost by 50%!
						  <br/><br/>To benefit from this reduction, the condition is very simple: you will have to become a <strong>mentor</strong> at Philos’ future training & bootcamp(s)! Basically, what we will ask from you is that you give <strong>14 hours</strong> of your time to come and help new cohort(s) of bootcampers in their tasks and share your knowledge with them.
							<!-- <br/><br/>If you do the math, you notice that you will be paid 1143,45€ (945€ + 21% VAT) for 14 hours, which is equal to a daily rate of 511,43€ if you work 8 hours a day.  -->
						  <br/><br/>Prior to attending the intensive training, we will need to receive <a href="doc/mentorship.pdf" target="_blank" class="philos-teal">this document</a>, signed by you, in which you agree to spend 14 hours mentoring Philos’ new bootcampers. 
						  <br/><br/>The mentoring has to happen within three months after the cohort you attended.</p></div>

					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q22. To Whom and by when do I have to pay the intensive training's tuition? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The tuition fees are due before joining the program. Until the amount has been paid, your spot will not be secured. If the amount is not paid before the beginning of the program, you won't be allowed to attend it.
					      <br/><br/>If accepted to participate to the intensive training, we will provide you with the payment information.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q23. I am a freelancer, may I pay the tuition in multiple payment? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
					      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Yes, we allow freelancers to pay their tuition in 2 payments. However, at least half of the tuition fees have to be paid <strong>before</strong> the program starts. If you benefited from the 50% reduction, then the remaining 50% of the tuition have to be paid in one go.</p></div>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      <div class="collapsible-header">Q24. Whom do I contact for additional questions? <!-- <i class="fa faq-icon fa-arrow-circle-o-down teal-active right"></i> --></div>
